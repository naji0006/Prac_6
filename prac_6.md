<h1>Introduction</h1>
Baggage Handling System (BHS) is one the most complex conveyor systems currently in practical use. This system is ranged from semi to fully-automated. A single flaw in this system can result in chaotic consequences as experienced in several major airports around the globe.
<h1>Initial Stage</h1>
At the very first stage where different various potential systems are discussed, a set of major factors must be taken into consideration.
Time and budget constraints: this indicates if the system can be developed in a test-driven (agile) manner, then every aspect of the design can be pre-tested before any physical implementation. This is usually achievable via developing a simulator to simulate the kind of functionality, general or specific, that is expected from a BHS.
Recovery plan: a sophisticated system, in this case BHS, would deliberately seek for potential threats to simulate a total failure scenario to execute extreme test on the design stage. This should result in designing a secondary mechanism (most likely fully-manual) in an event of failure in BHS in order to keep an airport in an operational state.
<h1>Operational Risks</h1>
BHS consists of many sub-systems and parts that are fully integrated into one main framework that executes the major functionality expected from the whole system (baggage handling). Based on circumstances and level of failure, system can cause different impacts on an airport operations. This could range from hardware failure caused by physical symptoms in the mechanical sections of BHS to more soft type of issues, such as failure in verification/identification process that could potentially result in non-programmed and system caused path changes results in baggage loss.
<h1>System Decomposition</h1>
As previously mentioned, BHS consists of various sub-systems and parts that are fully integrated into it, but there are only a few of them that could have a catastrophic impact on the whole system, and thereby on the whole operation of an airport. These are:
X-Ray Screening: this is the most important part of a BHS as the possible failure in operating a fully functional and accurate state could potentially endanger human lives. For instance, failure of detecting explosive devices can result in a major catastrophic event, such that lives are lost, and therefore recovery from it would not go beyond a less important (finical) factors.
Sorting: this part of BHS is normally full-automated, and as a result is less prone to human-caused errors. A failure in this section brings a massive liability an airport, as any misplacement of baggage into a wrong plane or a passenger would critically endanger personal property/belongings, and consequently put them at a risk of permanent loss.
Carrousel: this part of a BHS is more involved in the mechanical process of system, and generally is easier to fix in the event of a malfunction/failure. If in place, secondary mechanisms involving manual labour (non-automated) can mitigate the impact of failure, but if not in place, then the impact I just as severe as it is in the above part.
Check-in: this is perhaps the least important part (when considering BHS as an automated system, as this part mostly involves human factors). As such, failure is not necessary system-based. But, there is still a narrow probability that a system failure in this section could be rather catastrophic as the down-time could be considerably long (with the standards followed by major airports).
<h1>Essential Testings</h1>
Unit Testing: as per the information provided in the system decomposition section, there are several major parts that are exited in a BHS system. Each one this part is a considered a module of BHS and need to be separately tested with various testing inputs to capture and eliminate any possible risks that could occur during the course of each systemsâ€™ operation. 
Integration Testing: this testing has to be applied on the system after each individual modules are combined and integrated to form a BHS, and its ultimate goal is to make sure that BHS as a whole works the way it was planned. Bottom-up approach is more preferable in this system as it starts testings from lowest integrated levels which is more robust in terms of finding bugs.
Prototype Testing: considering the size of an airport, BHS system must be prototyped and fully-tested for any design flaws prior to any implementation. A good indication as to how an implemented system that had bypassed prototyping is the Denver international airport. Considering that they could predict and observed design flows in early prototype, could save them an enormous amount of time and resources.
<h1>Trivial Testings</h1>
Acceptance Testing: this test would be trivial as a BHS system must undergo major reviews and planning phases that generates extensive documentation on both functionality and formality of the system. 
Usability Testing: prototype testing is capable of demonstrating how a final system operates, therefore having usability on the final phase is redundant. Although this test can, at times when enough resources are available be executed on a prototype.
Compatibility Testing: this is perhaps the least important test in the context of BHS. A system with the magnitude and size of BHS has to have a major pre-planning phase in which compatibility is extensively examined and the development phase is totally reliant on, therefore upon finalising a BHS system, there has to be a confidence in place that it developed BHS has full compatibility with existing and future-planned base structures (as per planning and design documentation instructions).
